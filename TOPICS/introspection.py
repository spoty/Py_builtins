In computer programming, introspection refers to the ability to examine
something to determine what it is, what it knows, and what it is capable
of doing. Introspection gives programmers a great deal of flexibility and
control. Once you've worked with a programming language that supports
introspection, you may similarly feel that "the unexamined object is not
worth instantiating."
