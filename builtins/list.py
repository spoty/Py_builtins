list([iterable])

    Return a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable‘s
    items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports
    iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is
    made and returned, similar to iterable[:]. For instance, list('abc') returns
    ['a', 'b', 'c'] and list( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3]. If no argument is
    given, returns a new empty list, [].

    list is a mutable sequence type, as documented in Sequence Types — str,
    unicode, list, tuple, bytearray, buffer, xrange. For other containers see
    the built in dict, set, and tuple classes, and the collections module.
