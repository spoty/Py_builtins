""" Class inheritance

http://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/

  It helps to handle inheritance of ancestor class. This sounds a bit of messy.
  So I'll try to explain.

You have class A that does some useful things. And you have to use this class A
everywhere in your application with adding some piece of functionality. You may
inherit this class B(A) and expand it's functionality. Now you can use class B
instead of class A everywhere and get rid of redundant operations. """
