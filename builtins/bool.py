bool([x])

    Convert a value to a Boolean, using the standard truth testing procedure. If
    x is false or omitted, this returns False; otherwise it returns True. bool
    is also a class, which is a subclass of int. Class bool cannot be subclassed
    further. Its only instances are False and True.
