"""
 int(x, base=10)

    Convert a number or string x to an integer, or return 0 if no arguments
    are given. If x is a number, it can be a plain integer, a long integer, or
    a floating point number. If x is floating point, the conversion truncates
    towards zero. If the argument is outside the integer range, the function
    returns a long object instead.

    If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string or
    Unicode object representing an integer literal in radix base. Optionally,
    the literal can be preceded by + or - (with no space in between) and
    surrounded by whitespace. A base-n literal consists of the digits
    0 to n-1, with a to z (or A to Z) having values 10 to 35. The default
    base is 10. The allowed values are 0 and 2-36. Base-2, -8, and -16 literals
    can be optionally prefixed with 0b/0B, 0o/0O/0, or 0x/0X, as with integer
    literals in code. Base 0 means to interpret the string exactly as an
    integer literal, so that the actual base is 2, 8, 10, or 16.
